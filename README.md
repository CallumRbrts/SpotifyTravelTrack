# SpotifyTravelTrack
This is a project Project I did for University, I have added it to a public repo for people to see. I focused on the Spotify API and created a site that allows the user to plan a trip using bing maps and generate a playlist of the length of the trip from your other Spotify playlists. This playlist can then be saved to your Spotify Account or just added to your queue. Other features such as audio samples of each song. It was unfished but still merited an A.
